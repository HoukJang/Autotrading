## 📝 Configuration Example

```python
config = {
    "environment": "development",  # or "production"
    "broker": {
        "host": "127.0.0.1",
        "port": 7497,  # TWS: 7497, Gateway: 4001
        "client_id": 1
    },
    "database": {
        "host": "localhost",
        "port": 5432,
        "name": "trading_db",
        "user": "trader",
        "pool_size": 10
    },
    "risk": {
        "max_position_size": 5,
        "max_portfolio_risk": 0.02,
        "max_drawdown": 0.05,
        "emergency_liquidate_on_disconnect": True
    },
    "logging": {
        "level": "INFO",
        "file": "trading_system.log",
        "max_bytes": 104857600,  # 100MB
        "backup_count": 10
    }
}
```

## 🎓 Key Design Decisions

1. **ib_async over ibapi**: Better async support and cleaner API
2. **PostgreSQL over TimescaleDB**: Proven reliability with time-series optimization
3. **Event-driven architecture**: Enables loose coupling and scalability
4. **Plugin-based strategies**: Hot-swappable algorithms without system restart
5. **Local execution**: Minimizes latency for scalping strategies
